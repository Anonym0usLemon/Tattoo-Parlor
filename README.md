# Tattoo Parlor Website

This is a website I created for a fictitious Tattoo Parlor as part of a project to showcase my web development skills. The site is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across a wide range of screen sizes, from 350px to 2000px.

I initially developed the website from the ground up using ASP .NET while working at iNET, demonstrating my proficiency in server-side development. However, to further enhance its performance and interactivity, I later refactored the codebase into a React application, showcasing my expertise in modern front-end technologies.

This project not only highlights my technical abilities but also demonstrates my adaptability and willingness to embrace cutting-edge technologies to deliver optimal solutions. Feel free to explore the website and its code to see how I can bring innovation and quality to web development projects.
