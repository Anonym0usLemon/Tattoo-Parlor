# Project Name: Tattoo Parlor Website

## Project Description: 
This is a static responsive website for a tattoo parlor I built during my tenure as a frontend developer at iNET Web in Waukesha Wisconsin. It is fully responsive between 350px and 2000px. It's meant to show my experience turning Photoshop designs into frontend code.
